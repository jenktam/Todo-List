# Todo-List

This simple to-do list was build using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This exercise was bulit to expand my knowledge of jQuery and learn the tradeoffs between using jQuery over DOM Manipulation.

Overall, I prefer DOM over jQuery. Learning DOM first has given me a greater understanding and appreciation for what libraries like jQuery can accomplish. However, one of the main benefits of jQuery is that it's a wrapper that normalizes DOM Manipulation and allows you to easily select and create DOM elements(tags) through it's library selection of selectors and operations.
